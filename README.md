## Test - Part 1
### Trading Metrics and Strategy Test
Objective: To assess your full-stack development skills, engineering background, and understanding of trading strategies, we would like you to complete a mini-project. You will be given a data dump and are expected to compute various trading metrics, devise a profitable trading strategy, and output the performance of the strategy.
Data 
Please find the attached data here
Step 1: Compute Trading Metrics
Using the provided data, compute the following metrics:
Best Bid
Lowest Listing
Trade Price
Volatility for 1 hour, 6 hours, and 24 hours
Step 2: Log Metrics
Write a script to print the computed metrics into a log file. The log file should be formatted as follows:
Timestamp: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
Best Bid: X.XX
Lowest Listing: X.XX
Trade Price: X.XX
1h Volatility: X.XX
6h Volatility: X.XX
24h Volatility: X.XX
Task 3: Develop a Profitable Trading Strategy
Based on the computed metrics and the data provided, devise a profitable trading strategy. You may use any relevant algorithms or technical indicators to support your strategy.
Task 4: Print Buy/Sell Logs
Create a script to print out Buy and Sell logs for your trading strategy. The log should include:
Timestamp
Buy/Sell Signal
Trade Price
Task 5: Output PNL and Sharpe Ratio
Calculate the PNL (Profit and Loss) and Sharpe Ratio for your trading strategy. Print the results in the following format:
PNL: X.XX
Sharpe Ratio: X.XX

Once you have completed the tasks, please submit your code, log files, and a brief explanation of your chosen trading strategy. We will review your submission and assess your skills based on the quality and effectiveness of your work.

## Test Part 2
### Code Critique and Improvement Test
Objective: To assess your critical thinking skills and ability to identify areas for optimization, we would like you to review a sample piece of code, critique it, and suggest improvements.
Sample Code
In this folder is a function that computes pnl based on NFT transactions. There is also a sample transaction file in the folder. 
Task
Review the provided sample code and identify any issues related to:
Code efficiency
Readability
Redundancies
Error handling
Provide a detailed critique of the code, highlighting the areas where it can be improved.
Suggest specific improvements or alternative approaches that could optimize the code and address the identified issues.
Implement the suggested improvements in the code and provide a brief explanation of your changes.

Once you have completed the tasks, please submit your critique, suggestions, and improved code. We will review your submission and assess your skills based on your ability to identify issues and propose effective solutions.
